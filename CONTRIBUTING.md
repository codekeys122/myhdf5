## Quick start ðŸš€

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm start
```

## Development

- `pnpm start` - start myHDF5

### `pnpm` v7 cheat sheet

- `pnpm install` - install dependencies
- `pnpm add [-D] <pkg-name>` - [add a dependency](https://pnpm.io/cli/add)
- `pnpm [run] <script> [--<arg>]` - run a script
- `pnpm [exec] <binary>` - run a binary located in `node_modules/.bin`
  (equivalent to `npx <pkg-name>` for a package installed in the workspace)
- `pnpx <pkg-name>` - fetch a package from the registry and run its default
  command binary (equivalent to `npx <pkg-name>`)
- `pnpm why <pkg-name>` - show all packages that depend on the specified package
- `pnpm outdated` - list outdated dependencies
- `pnpm up -L <pkg-name>` - update a package to the latest version

### Dependency management

1. Run `pnpm outdated` to list dependencies that can be upgraded.
1. Read the changelogs and release notes of the dependencies you'd like to
   upgrade. Look for potential breaking changes, and for bug fixes and new
   features that may help improve the codebase.
1. Run `pnpm up -L <pkg-name>` to upgrade a dependency to the latest version.
   Alternatively, you can also edit `package.json` manually and run
   `pnpm install`, but make sure to specify an exact dependency version rather
   than a range (i.e. don't prefix the version with a caret or a tilde).

Beware of the following versioning requirements:

- The major version number of `@types/node` must match the version of Node
  specified in the `engine` field of `package.json`.
- The major version numbers of
  [DefinitelyTyped](https://github.com/DefinitelyTyped/DefinitelyTyped) packages
  must match the major version numbers of their corresponding dependencies (e.g.
  `@types/react@17` for `react@17`).

Note that `pnpm` offers multiple solutions for dealing with peer dependency
version conflicts and other package resolution issues:
[`pnpm.overrides`](https://pnpm.io/package_json#pnpmoverrides),
[`pnpm.packageExtensions`](https://pnpm.io/package_json#pnpmpackageextensions)
[`peerDependenciesMeta`](https://pnpm.io/package_json#peerdependenciesmeta),
[`.pnpmfile.cjs`](https://pnpm.io/pnpmfile).

## Build

- `pnpm build` - build myHDF5 for production
- `pnpm preview` - serve production build locally

## Code quality

- `pnpm lint` - run all linting and code formatting commands
- `pnpm lint:eslint` - lint all TS and JS files with ESLint
- `pnpm lint:tsc` - type-check the whole project, test files included
- `pnpm lint:prettier` - check that all files have been formatted with Prettier
- `pnpm analyze` - inspect the size and content of the JS bundles (after
  `pnpm build`)

### Automatic fixing and formatting

- `pnpm lint:eslint --fix` - auto-fix linting issues
- `pnpm lint:prettier --write` - format all files with Prettier

### Editor integration

Most editors support fixing and formatting files automatically on save. The
configuration for VSCode is provided out of the box, so all you need to do is
install the recommended extensions.
